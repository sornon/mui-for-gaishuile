It's still a work in progress, but hopefully you can see where we're headed.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nWe recommend that you get started with the [React Library](http://facebook.github.io/react/) before diving into material-ui for a better understanding. Should you choose to skip this, don't worry, we'll explain relevant React concepts as they come along.\n\n## Installation\n\nMaterial-UI is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.org/package/material-ui).\n```sh\nnpm install material-ui\n```\n\nUse [browserify](http://browserify.org/) and [reactify](https://github.com/andreypopp/reactify) for dependency management and JSX transformation. \n\n### React-Tap-Event-Plugin\nSome components use [react-tap-event-plugin](https://github.com/zilverline/react-tap-event-plugin) to\nlisten for touch events. This dependency is temporary and will go away once react v1.0 is released. Until then, be\nsure to inject this plugin at the start of your app.\n```js\nvar injectTapEventPlugin = require(\"react-tap-event-plugin\");\n\n//Needed for onTouchTap\n//Can go away when react 1.0 release\n//Check this repo:\n//https://github.com/zilverline/react-tap-event-plugin\ninjectTapEventPlugin();\n```\n\n### Roboto Font\nBe sure to include the [Roboto](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto) font in your project.\nHere are [some instructions](http://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Roboto:400,300,500) on how to include it in your project.\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce material-ui is included in your project, you can use the components this way:\n```js\n/** MyAwesomeReactComponent.jsx */\n\nvar React = require('react'),\n  mui = require('material-ui'),\n  RaisedButton = mui.RaisedButton;\n\nvar MyAwesomeReactComponent = React.createClass({\n\n  render: function() {\n    return (\n      <RaisedButton label=\"Default\" />\n    );\n  }\n\n});\n\nmodule.exports = MyAwesomeReactComponent;\n```\n\n## Customization\n\nMaterial-UI components have their styles defined inline. There are two approaches to overriding these styles:\n\n* Override individual component styles via the `style` prop\n* Define a Theme to apply overarching style changes\n\nThis allows you to override variables used by components without having to modify material-ui source files directly.\n\n## Examples\nThere are 2 projects that you can look at to help you get started. The first project can be found in the [example folder](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/master/example). This is a basic project that shows how you can consume material-ui components in your own project.\n\nThe second project is the actual documentation site. This is a more complex project but will give examples of every component. Check out the [docs folder](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/master/docs) for build instructions.\n\n## Contribute\n\n[Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/) came about from our love of [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Google's Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html). We're currently using it on a project at [Call-Em-All](https://www.call-em-all.com/) and plan on adding to it and making it better. If you'd like to help, check out the [docs folder](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/master/docs). We'd greatly appreciate any contribution you make. :)\n\n## License\nThis project is licensed under the terms of the [MIT license](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/blob/master/LICENSE)\n",
